###When Angular creates a component, it first asks an injector for the services that the component requires.

An injector maintains a container of service instances that it has previously created. If a requested service instance is not in the container, the injector makes one and adds it to the container before returning the service to Angular. When all requested services have been resolved and returned, 
Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments. This is dependency injection

###If the injector doesn't have a HeroService, how does it know how to make one?

In brief, you must have previously registered a provider of the HeroService with the injector.
A provider is something that can create or return a service, typically the service class itself
Registering at a component level means you get a new instance of the service with each new instance of that component.
