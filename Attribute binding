In Angular ,we bind to properties , not the attribute.


Some of the attributes have one to one mappping with the properties.

ex : < img [src] =" " />

but , <td [colspan] ="colspan"> </td> would throw an error as colspan is not a property of td element.
It's an attribute.https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_td.asp

To bind an attribute , we use 

[attr.colspan] ="colspan"
