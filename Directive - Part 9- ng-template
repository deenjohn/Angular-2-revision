The <ng-template>

https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#the-ng-template

The <ng-template> is an Angular element for rendering HTML. It is never displayed directly. 
In fact, before rendering the view, Angular replaces the <ng-template> and its contents with a comment.


If there is no structural directive and you merely wrap some elements in a <ng-template>, 
those elements disappear. That's the fate of the middle "Hip!" in the phrase "Hip! Hip! Hooray!".

src/app/app.component.html (template-tag)
 
<p>Hip!</p>
<ng-template>
  <p>Hip!</p>
</ng-template>
<p>Hooray!</p>
